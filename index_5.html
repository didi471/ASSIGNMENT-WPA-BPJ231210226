<h1> Challenges Faced By Generation Alpha </h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Environmental Factors: </b>Issues of air pollution, exposure to hazardous chemicals and climate change can impact children's health and development. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation can worsen respiratory conditions, allergies, and infectious diseases among the alpha generation.</li>
<li><b>Psychological Stress: </b>Although Generation Alpha is a digital native, Generation Alpha faces unique challenges in navigating the complexities of the modern world. Stress from academic expectations, social media influence and family dynamics can contribute to psychological stress and mental health issues. Anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders are increasingly common among children and adolescents, posing significant challenges to their overall well-being.</li>
<li><b>Sedentary Lifestyle: </b>One of the main reasons for health concerns around Generation Alpha is the prevalence of sedentary behavior. With the increase in technology and screen-based entertainment, children in this generation spend more time indoors and less time engaging in physical activity. This lack of exercise can lead to a variety of health problems, including obesity, cardiovascular problems, and musculoskeletal disorders.</li>
